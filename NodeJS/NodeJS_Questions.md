### 1.2 When to use NodeJs and when not to use it?

**What is Node.js used for?**
* Real-time applications
* IoT applications.
* Collaborative tools
* Data streaming applications
* Applications relying on scalability

**When is Node.js not a good idea?**

### 1.3 What is package.json?
The package.json file in Node.js is the heart of the entire application. It is basically the manifest file that contains the metadata of the project where we define the properties of a package.

### 1.4 What is the difference between dependencies and devDependencies in package.json?
`dependencies` are the modules that project requires to function effectively on production.    
`devDependencies` are the modules that is needed by the developer during development.  

also we have:  
`peerDependencies` are the modules that is needed when you creating npm packages.

### 1.5 What is npm?
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It makes it possible to install packages, manage dependencies and versions of the packages we use

NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.
www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.
The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js

### 1.6 What is the difference between Sync vs Async operations?
**Synchronous** code is also called “blocking” as it halts the program until all the resources are available.

Synchronous execution usually uses to code executing in sequence and the program is executed line by line, one line at a time. When a function is called, the program execution waits until that function returns before continuing to the next line of code.

**Asynchronous** code is also known as “non-blocking”. The program continues executing and doesn't wait for external resources (I/O) to be available.

Asynchronous execution applies to execution that doesn't run in the sequence it appears in the code. The program doesn't wait for the task to complete and can move on to the next task.

Phases Overview:  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**timers**: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval().  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**pending callbacks**: executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**idle, prepare**: only used internally.  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**poll**: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers, and setImmediate()); node will block here when appropriate.  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**check**: setImmediate() callbacks are invoked here.  
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`  
**close callbacks**: some close callbacks, e.g. socket.on('close', ...).
`Phases: nextTickQueue mickrotasks Queue`

Between each of these phases there is a phase with next and nextTickQueue microtasks Queue

### 1.8 Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?
NodeJS uses "Single Threaded Event Loop Model" architecture to handle multiple operations. However, libuv works multi-thread behind the scene.

### 1.9 What is the Event Emitter class? How it is related to other classes?

Events module in Node.js allows us to create and handle custom events. The Event module contains “EventEmitter” class which can be used to raise and handle custom events. It is accessible via the following code.

``` JavaScript
// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
```

When an EventEmitter instance encounters an error, it emits an “error” event. When a new listener gets added, it fires a “newListener” event and when a listener gets removed, it fires a “removeListener” event.
EventEmitter provides multiple properties like “on” and “emit”. The “on” property is used to bind a function to the event and “emit” is used to fire an event.

or

Event Emitters
EventEmitter is a class that helps us create a publisher-subscriber pattern in NodeJS.

With an event emitter, we can simply raise a new event from a different part of an application, and a listener will listen to the raised event and have some action performed for the event.

### 1.10 What kinds of streams does Node.js have?
Streams are objects that allow the reading of data from the source and writing of data to the destination as a continuous process.  

There are four types of streams:
**Writable** streams are the streams that data can be written on.  
**Readable** streams are the streams that data can be read from.  
**Duplex** streams are both readable and writeable streams.  
**Transform** streams are Duplex streams that can modify the data while being written and read.

Advantages of Streams over other data handling methods:

**Time Efficient:** We don’t have to wait until entire file has been transmitted. We can start processing data as soon as we have it.  
**Memory Efficient:** We don’t have to load huge amount of data in memory before we start processing.

Streams can be used when we are reading, writing, reading-writing or modifying data over a network or within the system
