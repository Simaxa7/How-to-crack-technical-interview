## What are Pure Components

The `React.PureComponent` differs from the `React.Component` in that it handles `shouldComponentUpdate()` state

`PureComponent` will do a shallow comparison on both props and state, when `props` or `state` changed

When shouldComponentUpdate is called the component will re-render by default  .
