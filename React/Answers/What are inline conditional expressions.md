## What are inline conditional expressions?

You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions.
```jsx
<h1>Hello!</h1>
{
    existVariable && existVariable.text
        ? <p2>{existVariable.text} </p2>
        : <p2>You don't have existVariable </p2>
}
```
