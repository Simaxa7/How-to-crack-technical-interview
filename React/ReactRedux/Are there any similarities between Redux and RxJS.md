## Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?

RxJS - is a `Observable` implementation for JS.

Redux - on other hand is state management library.

Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern.

Both these javascript libraries are not comparable to each other since it serve different purposes
