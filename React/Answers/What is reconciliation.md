## What is reconciliation?\
React provides a declarative API so that you donâ€™t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update. This makes writing applications a lot easier, but it might not be obvious how this is implemented within React.

Reconciliation is the process in which React kind of appears to reload data or the whole app on updates

The reconciliation process is triggered when the state or properties have been updated.
